# catch-of-the-day

Catch of the Day is a web application built using ReactJS for a seafood marketâ€™s inventory and ordering system. Users can:

View the inventory of the seafood market and the status of each item

Remove items from the inventory list

Place orders on available items in the inventory list

** This application was built following an online beginners React course by Wes Bos (https://reactforbeginners.com/), with a few of my own touches. 
This project reflects basic understanding of the React framework. The concept and overall coding practices are credited to Wes Bos. **
